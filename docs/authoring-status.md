# Card Authoring Status — Canonical Report

**Generated:** 2026-07-10 05:51 UTC  
**Git:** `43043ef4` on `feat/pb-ac9-misc-mana`  
**Source:** `tools/authoring-report.py`

This document is the single source of truth for card authoring progress. 
It is fully derived from the filesystem, the authoring plan JSON, and `git log`. 
Discussions of authoring strategy should reference this report, not stale prose docs.

**See [`authoring-status-guide.md`](authoring-status-guide.md) for how to read this report 
and what is intentionally NOT in it.**

## Bonus defs outside the plan

The plan was a one-shot snapshot at 2026-03-10; 
any card authored before plan generation OR added since (without re-running the planner) 
appears here. These are real cards, not noise — typically EDH staples, ability-batch 
reference cards, or sample cards shipped alongside primitive batches.

## Coverage by authoring-plan group

"Clean" / "TODO" / "Empty" subdivide the *authored* count by file quality. 
Groups with high authored-but-not-clean ratios are TODO-debt — the cards exist but 
are blocked on engine primitives.

| Group | Auth / Total | % | Clean | TODO | Empty |

### Lagging groups (≥5 cards in plan, <50% authored)

For each lagging group, the table below lists the cards that ARE authored 
with their quality bucket. If most are `todo` or `empty`, the group is 
**engine-blocked** (cards exist but need primitives). If they are `clean`, 
the group is just **unwritten** (need authoring effort). This split tells 
you which kind of next-step work would unblock the group.

#### `discard-effect` — 0 / 7 (0%), authored split: 0 clean / 0 todo / 0 empty — **unwritten**

#### `static-enchantment` — 0 / 8 (0%), authored split: 0 clean / 0 todo / 0 empty — **unwritten**

#### `activated-tap` — 2 / 27 (7%), authored split: 1 clean / 1 todo / 0 empty — **unwritten**

| Card | Slug | Bucket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fauna Shaman | `fauna_shaman` | todo |
| Maze of Ith | `maze_of_ith` | clean |

#### `untap-phase` — 1 / 13 (8%), authored split: 0 clean / 1 todo / 0 empty — **engine-blocked**

| Card | Slug | Bucket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seedborn Muse | `seedborn_muse` | todo |

#### `activated-sacrifice` — 3 / 19 (16%), authored split: 1 clean / 2 todo / 0 empty — **engine-blocked**

| Card | Slug | Bucket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Altar of Dementia | `altar_of_dementia` | clean |
| Birthing Pod | `birthing_pod` | todo |
| Bolas's Citadel | `bolass_citadel` | todo |

#### `sacrifice-outlet` — 1 / 6 (17%), authored split: 1 clean / 0 todo / 0 empty — **unwritten**

| Card | Slug | Bucket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Life's Legacy | `lifes_legacy` | clean |

#### `attack-trigger` — 6 / 34 (18%), authored split: 2 clean / 4 todo / 0 empty — **engine-blocked**

| Card | Slug | Bucket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aurelia, the Warleader | `aurelia_the_warleader` | clean |
| Etali, Primal Storm | `etali_primal_storm` | todo |
| Hellrider | `hellrider` | todo |
| Sanctum Seeker | `sanctum_seeker` | clean |
| Shared Animosity | `shared_animosity` | todo |
| Six | `six` | todo |

## TODO classification (top 25)

Each TODO line is matched against engine-gap patterns. "OTHER" means unclassified — 
either a stale TODO (primitive now exists), a card-specific note, or a gap not yet 
in the classifier (`tools/authoring-report.py` `TODO_BUCKETS`). The OTHER bucket is 
the next thing to triage when the classifier table is grown.

| Gap bucket | TODO lines | Δ since last run |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| OTHER (unclassified) | 628 | -1 |
| DSL gap (unspecified) | 133 | · |
| attack trigger (self / generic) | 27 | · |
| TriggerCondition::* missing variant | 17 | · |
| dynamic hexproof / protection | 17 | · |
| Cost::* missing variant | 17 | · |
| sacrifice as cost | 16 | · |
| replacement effect missing | 14 | · |
| EffectAmount::* missing variant | 13 | · |
| TargetFilter missing field | 12 | · |
| combat-damage-to-player trigger | 10 | · |
| interactive / hidden-info choice | 10 | · |
| opponent-action trigger | 8 | · |
| can't / must block-attack | 7 | · |
| can't be countered | 7 | · |
| per-player effect dispatch | 6 | · |
| per-opponent upkeep | 6 | · |
| devotion | 5 | · |
| conditional static / grant | 5 | · |
| equipment grants ability | 5 | · |
| X-scaled tokens | 4 | · |
| count-threshold static | 4 | · |
| delayed triggers | 4 | · |
| untap-all / untap trigger | 4 | · |
| noncombat-damage prevent | 4 | · |

_…and 30 more buckets totaling 55 lines._

### Raw OTHER samples (read these to design new classifier buckets)

Showing 12 of 628 
unclassified TODO lines. If two or three of these have a common theme, that's a 
new bucket to add to `TODO_BUCKETS` in `tools/authoring-report.py`. Sample is 
deterministic (sorted by slug).

## How to update this report

```
python3 tools/authoring-report.py
```

To extend the TODO classifier, add `(re.compile(...), "bucket name")` tuples to 
`TODO_BUCKETS` in `tools/authoring-report.py` and re-run.

To change the universe target or plan source, edit `PLAN` at the top of the script.
