`RETIRED` (replaced by another workstream)

## Last Handoff

**Date**: 2026-03-24
**Workstream**: W6 (PB-25)
**Task**: PB-25 continuous effect grants

**Completed**:
- **PB-25 DONE**: 11 new EffectFilter variants, 28 card defs fixed, 13 new tests. Review: clean (0 findings). 2287 tests, 0 clippy.
- Commit: 0e6605f (implement).

**Next**:
1. Continue gap closure: PB-26 (trigger variants, ~72 cards) is next
2. ~201 card defs still need backfill sweep for PB-24 conditions
3. ~70 cards remaining from PB-25 scope (need other PB gaps first)

**Hazards**:
- Backfill not yet run for PB-24 conditions
- Some PB-25 scope cards also need PB-26 triggers or PB-29 cost reduction

**Commit prefix used**: `W6-prim:`
