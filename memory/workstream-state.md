## Last Handoff

**Date**: 2026-03-13
**Workstream**: W5: Card Authoring
**Task**: Phase 2 Wave 2 — combat-keyword (187 cards) — full cycle: author → review → fix → commit

**Completed**:
- Authored 187 cards across 14 sessions (26–39) via bulk-card-author agents (2 in parallel)
- Compile fixes during authoring: `EffectLayer::PowerToughness` → `PtModify`, no `KeywordAbility::CantBlock` variant, `ManaCost` missing `colorless` field
- 38 review batches run in parallel (4 at a time) via card-batch-reviewer agents
- Fix pass (13 HIGHs): World supertype, CantBeBlocked on Invisible Stalker, wrong target filter (Tamiyo's Safekeeping), Concordant Crossroads, approximate-targeting cards emptied (Ram Through, Legolas), Markov Baron Convoke+Madness, Hammer of Nazahn implemented, Crown of Skemfar Enchant+Reach, Nullpriest Kicker, Nezumi Prowler Ninjutsu cost, Mindleecher MutateCost, Ajani CMC, */* CDA creatures `Some(0)→None`
- Committed `d83ac94` (author) + `01e3b52` (fixes) — 1944 tests pass; 640 total card defs
- Wave plan: `memory/card-authoring/wave-002-combat-keyword.md` (COMPLETE)

**Next**:
1. W5 Wave 3: Mana Lands (92 cards, 7 sessions, batch 16) — sessions from `_authoring_plan.json` group `mana-land`; create `memory/card-authoring/wave-003-mana-land.md`; reference: `command_tower.rs`
2. W3 T3: ManaPool::spend() encapsulation (last unchecked Phase 3 item)

**Hazards**: `*/*` CDA creatures must use `power: None, toughness: None` (not `Some(0)`) — engine SBA uses `toughness?` which skips None. Aura cards need `Enchant(EnchantTarget::Creature)` keyword. Ninjutsu/Mutate cards need BOTH the keyword marker AND the cost `AbilityDefinition`.

**Commit prefix used**: `W5-cards:`
