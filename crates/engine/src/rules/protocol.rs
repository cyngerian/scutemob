//! Wire protocol versioning for `Command` and `GameEvent` streams.
//!
//! `Command` is the only way into the engine and `GameEvent` is the only way out
//! (invariants #3 and #4), so the two enums *are* the wire protocol for M10's
//! centralized server, and they are what a replay log is made of. This module
//! puts a version tag on those serialized streams and defines what happens when
//! it does not match.
//!
//! # Policy: strict lockstep
//!
//! A message declares `protocol_version`. A receiver accepts it **iff** the
//! declared version equals [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] exactly. Anything else is
//! rejected with [`ProtocolError::VersionMismatch`]. There is no negotiation, no
//! forward compatibility, and no best-effort decoding of an unknown version.
//!
//! The reason is invariant #9. Rewind, replay, and pause all rest on a complete
//! and accurate state history from turn 1. A client that silently drops an event
//! variant it does not understand, or that fills a missing field with a default,
//! holds a history that cannot be correctly rewound — and it holds it *without
//! knowing*. Refusing the connection is recoverable; a corrupted history is not.
//!
//! # The version number is machine-checked, not remembered
//!
//! A hand-bumped constant next to a growing enum is precisely the kind of
//! process guarantee the SR track exists to convert into a machine guarantee: it
//! is correct exactly as long as every future author remembers it. So
//! [`PROTOCOL_SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT`] pins a digest of the **transitive type
//! closure** of the three wire frames — `Command`, `GameEvent`, [`ReplayLog`] —
//! computed from workspace source by `tests/protocol_schema.rs`. Change the
//! shape of anything on the wire and that test fails, names the drift, and tells
//! you to bump [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`].
//!
//! The closure is 90 types, not 3. `GameEvent::CreatureDied` carries
//! `Option<Characteristics>`, which reaches `AbilityInstance` → `Effect` →
//! `TargetFilter` → the whole card DSL. **Adding an `Effect` variant is a wire
//! change**, so most primitive batches (PB-*) will bump this version. That is
//! not gate noise; it is what strict lockstep means.
//!
//! It bottoms out cleanly: `GameState` is *not* in the closure. Whole-state sync
//! is a different question, guarded by `HASH_SCHEMA_VERSION`
//! (`state::hash`), and a replay log carries both — see [`ReplayLog`].
//!
//! Full rationale, bump procedure, and known holes:
//! `docs/mtg-engine-protocol-versioning.md`.

/// # History
/// - 1: SR-8 (2026-07-10) — initial versioned envelope. Baseline shape is the
///   90-type closure recorded in [`PROTOCOL_SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT`].
/// - 2: SR-10 (2026-07-10) — `Command::CastSpell`'s ~16-field payload boxed into
///   a new [`crate::rules::command::CastSpellData`] struct (clippy::large_enum_variant;
///   shrinks every `Command` value and replay-log entry). The serialized **bytes**
///   are unchanged — a boxed newtype variant wrapping a struct is serde-identical to
///   the former struct variant — but the shape digest moved because the closure grew
///   by one type (90 → 91) and the variant's declared form changed. Bumped per this
///   gate's policy that any non-variant-reorder digest move bumps the version.
/// - 3: SR-34 (2026-07-17) — `ManaAbility` (reachable from `Command`/`GameEvent` via
///   `Characteristics.mana_abilities: Vec<ManaAbility>`, a [`CLOSURE_MUST_CONTAIN`]
///   entry) gains `mana_cost: Option<ManaCost>` and `life_cost: u32`, its activation
///   cost's mana and life components (CR 605.1a — a mana ability is classified by
///   what it does, not what it costs; `handle_tap_for_mana` now pays these). The
///   closure stays 91 types (no new type joins it, `ManaCost` was already in the
///   closure), but `ManaAbility`'s declared shape changed, so the digest moves.
/// - 4: SR-36 (2026-07-17) — SF-8/SF-9: `ManaAbility` gains
///   `scaled_amount: Option<Box<EffectAmount>>` (a dynamic mana amount, CR 605.1a) and
///   `ActivationCost` (reachable via `Characteristics.activated_abilities: Vec<ActivatedAbility>`
///   → `ActivatedAbility.cost: ActivationCost`) gains `life_cost: u32` (CR 118.3/119.4
///   — a non-mana activated ability's life-payment component). `EffectAmount` was
///   already in the closure (via `Effect`), so the closure's type count is unchanged;
///   both structs' declared shapes moved, so the digest moves.
/// - 5: SR-37 (2026-07-17) — SF-10: `ManaAbility` gains
///   `activation_condition: Option<Condition>` (an "activate only if ..." restriction,
///   CR 605.1a + CR 602.5b — Tainted Field's coloured arms). `Condition` was already in
///   the closure (reachable via `Effect::Conditional`), so the closure's type count is
///   unchanged; `ManaAbility`'s declared shape moved, so the digest moves.
/// - 6: PB-EF1 (2026-07-18) — `ActivationCost` (reachable via
///   `Characteristics.activated_abilities` → `ActivatedAbility.cost`) gains
///   `sacrifice_exclude_self: bool` (CR 109.1 — the "Sacrifice ANOTHER [permanent]"
///   restriction on an activated ability's sacrifice cost; `SacrificeFilter` carries no
///   ObjectId so the bit rides on `ActivationCost`). The closure's type count is
///   unchanged; `ActivationCost`'s declared shape moved, so the digest moves.
/// - 7: PB-EF2 (2026-07-18) — `TokenSpec` (reachable via `Effect::CreateToken`/
///   `Effect::CreateTokenAndAttachSource`) gains `recipient: PlayerTarget` (CR 111.1 /
///   CR 608.2h — which player creates the token(s); "its controller creates …" cards

///   `ControllerOfCounteredSpell` and `ControllerOfTriggeringObject`. The closure's
///   type count is unchanged; both types' declared shapes moved, so the digest moves.
/// - 8: PB-EF3 (2026-07-18) — `EffectTarget` (reachable via `Effect::DealDamage.target`
///   and other `Effect` variants) gains `AttackTarget`; `PlayerTarget` (already in the
///   closure) gains `DefendingPlayer` (CR 508.4 — the defending player / attack target
///   of an attacking creature, EF-W-MISS-4/EF-W-MISS-10). The closure's type count is
///   unchanged; both types' declared shapes moved, so the digest moves.
/// - 9: PB-EF4 (2026-07-18) — `Effect::DealDamage` (reachable via `Effect` and thus in
///   the closure already) gains `source: Option<EffectTarget>` (CR 119.3 / 702.15a — an
///   optional damage-source override, e.g. "the entering creature deals it", resolved
///   to a single ObjectId at execution time; `EffectTarget` was already in the closure).

///   bump only, not a PROTOCOL_VERSION one.)

///   variant `TransformSelf` (CR 701.27a/f, 712.18 — flip the resolving ability's own

///   (CR 102.3/102.4/115.1/601.2c/603.3d — "target opponent", an opponent-restricted

///   gains `modes: Option<ModeSelection>` (CR 700.2a/601.2b — modal activated

///   `AbilityDefinition::Spell`/`Triggered`). The closure's type count is unchanged;
///   both `Command` and `AbilityDefinition`'s declared shapes moved, so the digest moves.
/// - 13: PB-EF8 (2026-07-18) — `Cost` (reachable via `AbilityDefinition::Activated.cost`)
///   gains a new unit variant `ExileSelfFromHand` (CR 118 + CR 400.7 + CR 605.1a — a
///   from-hand mana ability's exile-self activation cost, e.g. Simian/Elvish Spirit
///   Guide), and `ActivationZone` (reachable via `AbilityDefinition::Activated.activation_zone`)
///   gains a new unit variant `Hand` (CR 602.2 — decorative marker; the mana-lowering
///   path keys off `Cost::ExileSelfFromHand` alone, not this field). The closure's type
///   count is unchanged; both `Cost` and `ActivationZone`'s declared shapes moved, so the

///   `Effect::ApplyContinuousEffect(ContinuousEffectDef)` → the card DSL closure) gains
///   a new variant `WhileYouControlSource(PlayerId)` (CR 611.2b/c — "for as long as you

/// - 18: PB-EF12 (2026-07-18) — `Command::TapForMana` (a wire frame) gains
///   `chosen_color: Option<ManaColor>` (CR 605.3b/106.1b — a mana ability resolves
///   immediately and never uses the stack, so the colour choice for an `any_color`

/// - 19: PB-OS4 (2026-07-19, SHIP NARROWED) — `Effect` (already in the closure)
///   gains one new unit variant, `ExileSourceAndReturnTransformed` (CR 400.7 /
///   712.18 — a permanent that leaves and returns to the battlefield already
///   transformed is a NEW object, unlike `TransformSelf`'s in-place flip;
