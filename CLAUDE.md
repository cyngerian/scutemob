## Current State

- **Active Milestone**: M7 — Card Definition Framework & First Cards
- **Status**: M6 complete — combat phase (CR 506-511) fully implemented and tested; 272 tests passing
- **Last Updated**: 2026-02-21

### What Exists (M6 complete)
- Everything from M5, plus:
- `state/combat.rs`: `AttackTarget` enum (Player/Planeswalker), `CombatState` struct (attackers, blockers, damage_assignment_order, first_strike_damage_resolved, defenders_declared, attacking_player)
- `rules/combat.rs`: Full combat handler module
  - `handle_declare_attackers`: taps non-Vigilance attackers, records in CombatState, fires SelfAttacks triggers, grants priority
  - `handle_declare_blockers`: records blockers per attacker, fires SelfBlocks triggers (no priority change)
  - `handle_order_blockers`: sets damage_assignment_order for multi-blocker attackers
  - `apply_combat_damage(state, first_strike_step)`: simultaneous damage (CR 510.2); trample, deathtouch, commander damage tracking; two-phase (collect then apply) to avoid borrow conflicts
  - `should_have_first_strike_step`: checks if any combatant has FirstStrike or DoubleStrike
- `rules/turn_actions.rs`: `begin_combat`, `first_strike_damage_step`, `combat_damage_step`, `end_combat` step actions
- `rules/turn_structure.rs`: conditionally inserts `FirstStrikeDamage` step between DeclareBlockers and CombatDamage
- `state/game_object.rs`: `TriggerEvent::SelfAttacks` and `SelfBlocks` variants added
- `rules/abilities.rs`: `AttackersDeclared` and `BlockersDeclared` trigger handlers added
- New commands: `DeclareAttackers`, `DeclareBlockers`, `OrderBlockers`
- New events: `AttackersDeclared`, `BlockersDeclared`, `CombatDamageDealt` (with `CombatDamageAssignment`/`CombatDamageTarget`), `CombatEnded`
- Commander damage: tracked in `PlayerState.commander_damage_received` during `apply_combat_damage` (CR 903.10a)
- 11 tests in `tests/combat.rs`; 272 total, zero clippy warnings
  - Unblocked damage, blocked (no trample), mutual death, first strike, double strike, trample, deathtouch+trample, multiple blockers, SelfAttacks trigger, commander damage, multiplayer attacks
- Deferred to M7+: "deals combat damage to a player" triggers; damage prevention

### What Exists (M5 complete)
- Everything from M4, plus:
- `state/continuous_effect.rs`: `EffectId`, `EffectLayer` (10 variants: Copy/Control/Text/TypeChange/ColorChange/Ability/PtCda/PtSet/PtModify/PtSwitch), `EffectDuration` (3), `EffectFilter` (10), `LayerModification` (21 variants), `ContinuousEffect`
- `rules/layers.rs`: `calculate_characteristics(state, object_id) -> Option<Characteristics>`
  - Layers 1–7d in strict order; CDAs first (CR 613.3); dependency order then timestamp order (CR 613.7, 613.8)
  - `depends_on()`: `SetTypeLine` depends on `AddSubtypes`/`AddCardTypes` — handles Blood Moon + Urborg correctly regardless of timestamp
  - `toposort_with_timestamp_fallback()`: Kahn's algorithm; circular dependencies fall back to timestamp
  - `is_effect_active()`: `WhileSourceOnBattlefield` lazily evaluated; `UntilEndOfTurn` always active until removed
  - Counter P/T modifications (CR 613.4c) applied inline at Layer 7c
  - Layer 1 (Copy): placeholder for M7; Layer 2 (Control): `SetController` defined, controller on `GameObject`
- `rules/layers::expire_end_of_turn_effects()`: removes `UntilEndOfTurn` effects, called from `cleanup_actions`
- `GameStateBuilder::add_continuous_effect()`: builder method for test state construction
- `testing/script_schema.rs`: `GameScript` schema (Hook 1, done in M5)
- 28 new tests in `tests/layers.rs`; 261 total, zero clippy warnings
  - Humility + Opalescence, Blood Moon + Urborg (both timestamp orderings), dependency chains, CDAs, layer ordering, duration expiry

### What Exists (M4 complete)
- Everything from M3, plus:
- `rules/sba.rs`: `check_and_apply_sbas` (fixed-point loop) with all CR 704.5 SBAs
  - 704.5a: player at 0 or less life loses; 704.5c: 10+ poison counters
  - 704.5d: token in non-battlefield zone ceases to exist
  - 704.5f: creature toughness ≤ 0; 704.5g: lethal damage; 704.5h: deathtouch damage
  - 704.5i: planeswalker at 0 loyalty; 704.5j: legendary rule (auto-keeps newest)
  - 704.5m: aura attached to illegal object; 704.5n: equipment attached illegally
  - 704.5q: +1/+1 and -1/-1 counter annihilation; 704.5u: commander damage 21+
- SBA check integrated into `engine.rs::enter_step` and `resolution.rs` (before every priority grant)
- New events: `CreatureDied`, `PlaneswalkerDied`, `AuraFellOff`, `EquipmentUnattached`, `TokenCeasedToExist`, `CountersAnnihilated`, `LegendaryRuleApplied`
- `deathtouch_damage: bool` added to `GameObject` and `ObjectSpec` (with `with_deathtouch_damage()` and `with_damage()` builder methods)
- 28 new tests in `tests/sba.rs`; 230 total, zero clippy warnings

### What Exists (M3 complete)
- Everything from M2, plus:
- `blake3 = "1"` dependency for deterministic hashing
- `HashInto` trait in `state/hash.rs`: manual field-by-field hashing into `blake3::Hasher`
- `public_state_hash()` on `GameState`: hashes all publicly visible state (turn, players, public zones, effects, combat); excludes hand/library contents and history
- `private_state_hash(player)` on `GameState`: hashes hand contents, library contents (ordered), face-down cards
- 19 hashing tests: determinism (3), sensitivity (7), public/private partition (4), dual-instance proptest (3+proptest)
- **M3-A complete**: Stack foundation, mana abilities, PlayLand and TapForMana commands
  - `state/stack.rs`: `StackObject` + `StackObjectKind` (Spell, ActivatedAbility, TriggeredAbility)
  - `ManaAbility` struct in `game_object.rs` with `tap_for()` helper; `mana_abilities` field in `Characteristics`
  - `ObjectSpec.with_mana_ability()` builder method

  - `TapForMana` and `PlayLand` commands with `LandPlayed`, `ManaAdded`, `PermanentTapped` events
  - `rules/mana.rs`: CR 605 handler; `rules/lands.rs`: CR 305.1 handler
  - 19 new tests in `tests/mana_and_lands.rs`
- **M3-C complete**: Stack resolution — all-pass → resolve top of stack (LIFO)
  - `rules/resolution.rs`: `resolve_top_of_stack` (CR 608.1/608.2n/608.3a) + `counter_stack_object` (CR 608.2b)
  - Instant/sorcery → owner's graveyard; permanent → battlefield under caster's control
  - `handle_all_passed` in engine.rs now branches: non-empty stack → resolve, empty → advance step
  - 3 new events: `SpellResolved`, `PermanentEnteredBattlefield`, `SpellCountered`
  - 10 new tests in `tests/resolution.rs`; 178 total, zero clippy warnings
- **M3-B complete**: CastSpell command, casting windows, Flash, priority reset
  - `keywords: OrdSet<KeywordAbility>` added to `Characteristics` (hash.rs updated; `ObjectSpec.with_keyword()` builder method)
  - `Command::CastSpell { player, card }` — no cost/targets yet (M3-D)
  - `GameEvent::SpellCast { player, stack_object_id, source_object_id }`
  - `rules/casting.rs`: CR 601 handler — validates casting speed (instant vs sorcery), moves card to Stack zone (CR 400.7 new ID), pushes `StackObject`, resets priority to active player (CR 601.2i)
  - Sorcery speed: active player + main phase + empty stack; Flash/Instants bypass all three
  - After casting, ACTIVE PLAYER gets priority (not necessarily the caster) — this differs from PlayLand which lets caster retain
  - 12 new tests in `tests/casting.rs`
- **M3-E complete**: Triggered/activated abilities, APNAP ordering, intervening-if
  - `rules/abilities.rs`: `handle_activate_ability` (CR 602), `check_triggers` (CR 603.2), `flush_pending_triggers` (CR 603.3), `apnap_order`, `check_intervening_if` (CR 603.4)

  - `Characteristics` gains `activated_abilities: Vec<ActivatedAbility>` and `triggered_abilities: Vec<TriggeredAbilityDef>`
  - `PendingTrigger` struct replaces stub `TriggeredAbility` in `stubs.rs`
  - `Command::ActivateAbility { player, source, ability_index, targets }` added

  - Intervening-if checked at trigger time AND resolution time (CR 603.4)
  - `ObjectSpec.with_activated_ability()` and `.with_triggered_ability()` builder methods
  - 15 new tests in `tests/abilities.rs`
- `.cargo/config.toml`: `RUST_MIN_STACK = "33554432"` — 32 MiB for all test threads; fixes debug-mode stack overflows from large struct sizes in GameStateBuilder::build()
- `activated_abilities` and `triggered_abilities` use `Vec<T>` (not `im::Vector<T>`) — static card data; reduces Characteristics stack footprint
- 202 tests passing total, zero clippy warnings

### What Exists (M2 complete)
- Everything from M1, plus:
- `Command` enum (`PassPriority`, `Concede`) in `rules/command.rs`
- `GameEvent` enum (14 variants) in `rules/events.rs` — replaces stub; `LossReason` enum
- `process_command()` free function in `rules/engine.rs` — single public entry point for all game actions
- `start_game()` for initializing the first turn
- Turn FSM in `rules/turn_structure.rs`: `STEP_ORDER`, `advance_step`, `advance_turn`, `next_player_in_turn_order`

- Extra turn queue (LIFO) with proper normal-order resumption after extra turns
- CR 103.8: first player skips first draw
- CR 104.3b: draw from empty library → player loses
- Eliminated players skipped in turn order and priority
- Removed duplicate `turn_number` field from `GameState` (now only in `TurnState`)
- Builder additions: `at_step()`, `active_player()`, `first_turn_of_game()`, `max_hand_size()`
- New error variants: `NotPriorityHolder`, `GameAlreadyOver`, `PlayerEliminated`, `NoActivePlayers`, `LibraryEmpty`, `InvalidCommand`
- 104 tests passing (33 new M2 + 71 existing), zero clippy warnings
- Test coverage: turn structure (6), priority (7), turn actions (7), extra turns (4), concede (5), proptest invariants (4)

### What Exists (M1 complete)
- Everything from M0, plus:
- `GameState` struct with `im::OrdMap`/`OrdSet`/`Vector` for all fields (deterministic iteration)

## Project Overview

We are building an MTG rules engine targeting **Commander format** (4-player multiplayer) with
**networked play**. The engine is written in **Rust**, the desktop app uses **Tauri v2** with a
**Svelte** frontend.

The engine is a standalone library crate with no UI or network dependencies. It can be tested
entirely in isolation. The network layer wraps the engine. The Tauri app wraps the network layer.

## Coding Conventions

### Rust Style

- **Edition**: 2021
- **Formatting**: `rustfmt` with default settings. Run `cargo fmt` before every commit.
- **Linting**: `cargo clippy` with `-D warnings`. No clippy warnings allowed in CI.
- **Error handling**: Use `thiserror` for library errors, `anyhow` in binaries/tools only.
  The engine crate uses typed errors — never `unwrap()` or `expect()` in engine logic.
  Tests may use `unwrap()`.
- **Naming**:
  - Types: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/methods: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Modules: `snake_case`
  - Test functions: `test_<rule_number_or_feature>_<scenario>` (e.g., `test_704_5f_zero_toughness_creature_dies`)

### Comprehensive Rules Citation Format

Every rules implementation MUST cite the CR section it implements. Use this format:

```rust
/// Implements CR 704.5f: "If a creature has toughness 0 or less, it's put into
/// its owner's graveyard. Regeneration can't replace this event."
fn check_zero_toughness(state: &GameState) -> Vec<GameEvent> {
    // ...
}
```

For tests, cite the rule AND the source of the test case:

```rust
#[test]
/// CR 704.5f — creature with 0 toughness dies as SBA
/// Source: CR example under 704.5f
fn test_704_5f_zero_toughness_creature_dies() {
    // ...
}

#[test]
/// CR 613.10 — Humility + Opalescence interaction
/// Source: CR example under 613.10, confirmed by Forge engine
fn test_613_10_humility_opalescence() {
    // ...
}
```

### Testing Conventions

- **Test location**: Unit tests in `crates/engine/tests/`, not inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
  This keeps the source files clean and allows tests to access the public API only (black-box testing).
- **GameStateBuilder**: Always use the builder to construct test states. Never manually construct
  `GameState` structs — the builder ensures invariants.
- **One assertion focus per test**: Tests should have a clear, single behavior they're verifying.
  Multiple related assertions are fine, but the test name should describe the specific behavior.
- **Test naming**: `test_<system>_<scenario>_<expected_behavior>`
  - Good: `test_sba_creature_zero_toughness_goes_to_graveyard`
  - Good: `test_priority_all_four_players_pass_stack_resolves`
  - Bad: `test_combat` (too vague)
  - Bad: `test_1` (meaningless)
- **Golden test format**: JSON files in `test-data/golden-games/`. Schema documented in
  architecture doc Section 6.4.
- **Property tests**: Use `proptest` crate. Define invariants in `tests/properties/`.

### Commit Conventions

- **Format**: `M<number>: <short description>` (e.g., `M1: implement GameState struct with zone system`)
- **PR scope**: One logical change per PR. A PR can span multiple files but should have one purpose.
- **Tests required**: Every PR that changes engine logic must include or update tests.
- **Benchmark check**: If the PR touches state cloning, layer calculation, or SBA checks,
  run benchmarks and note any regression.

### Dependencies Policy

- **Engine crate**: Minimal dependencies. `im` (persistent data structures), `serde` (serialization),
  `thiserror` (error types). No async runtime, no IO, no network, no UI.
- **Network crate**: `tokio`, `tokio-tungstenite` or `axum`, `serde`, `rmp-serde` (MessagePack).
- **Card-db crate**: `rusqlite`, `serde`.
- **Tauri app**: `tauri`, `serde`, whatever the frontend needs.

The engine crate must NEVER depend on the network, card-db, or tauri-app crates. Information
flows inward: the app depends on network, network depends on engine. Never the reverse.

---

## Architecture Invariants

These are non-negotiable. If a change would violate any of these, stop and reconsider.

1. **Engine is a pure library.** No IO, no network, no filesystem access, no async runtime
   in the engine crate. It takes commands in and emits state changes out. Everything else
   is the caller's responsibility.

2. **Game state is immutable.** Use `im-rs` persistent data structures. State transitions
   produce new states; old states are retained for undo/replay. Never mutate state in place.

3. **All player actions are Commands.** There is no way to change game state except through
   the Command enum. This enables networking, replay, and deterministic testing.

4. **All state changes are Events.** The engine emits Events describing what happened.
   The network layer broadcasts these. The UI consumes these. Events are the single
   source of truth for "what happened."

5. **Multiplayer-first.** Priority, triggers, combat — everything is designed for N players.
   1v1 is N=2, not a special case.

6. **Commander-first.** The command zone, commander tax, commander damage, color identity —
   these are core features, not bolted-on extensions.

7. **Hidden information is enforced.** The engine knows everything. In the distributed
   verification model (see `docs/mtg-engine-network-security.md`), each peer runs
   the engine independently and only knows their own private state. Cryptographic
   protocols (Mental Poker) protect hidden information. Never expose another player's
   hand or library order.

8. **Tests cite their rules source.** Every test references the CR section or known
   interaction it validates. Untraceable tests are technical debt.

## Key Design Decisions Log

Record significant decisions here so future sessions have context for WHY things are
the way they are. Format: date, decision, rationale.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| (project start) | Rust for engine, Tauri for app | Performance for layer calculations; Tauri gives native Rust backend + web UI without Electron overhead |
| (project start) | `im-rs` for immutable state | Structural sharing makes state snapshots O(1); enables free undo/replay; fits Rust ownership model |
| (project start) | Command/Event model | Single pattern for networking, replay, testing, and undo; enforces determinism |
| (project start) | Authoritative host (not P2P) | Hidden information requires a trusted authority; simpler than consensus protocols |
| 2026-02-21 | Distributed verification replaces authoritative host | Eliminates trusted host; all peers run engine independently; coordinator is lightweight; see `docs/mtg-engine-network-security.md` |
| 2026-02-21 | Three-tier network security (hashing → distributed → Mental Poker) | Tier 1 (state hashing) catches non-determinism early; Tier 2 (all peers verify) prevents tampering; Tier 3 (cryptographic dealing) protects hidden information |
| 2026-02-21 | Deterministic state hashing from M3 onward | Catching non-determinism during engine development is dramatically cheaper than discovering it during M10 networking |
| 2026-02-21 | M4 legendary rule auto-keeps newest permanent (highest ObjectId) | Real player choice requires a choice Command that doesn't exist until M7; auto-newest is deterministic, testable, and matches common play |
| 2026-02-21 | Game script generation deferred to M7; schema defined in M5 | Generating scripts before the replay harness (M7) risks format drift and wasted effort since scripts can't run. Schema defined now so it compiles and evolves. All generation happens in M7 when scripts run immediately against the harness. |
| 2026-02-21 | Rewind, pause, and manual mode are network/UI features, not engine features | im-rs structural sharing makes state history free. Engine only needs a `reveals_hidden_info()` classification method on GameEvent (M9, ~10 lines). Coordinated rewind (unanimous consent) and Pause/Resume commands live in M10 network layer. Manual state adjustment UI lives in M11. Secret information protection across rewinds is honour-system only — app surfaces a warning but does not block; this is acceptable for the trusted-friends use case. |
| 2026-02-21 | SBA check added to all priority-grant sites (enter_step, resolve_top_of_stack, fizzle, counter) | CR 704.3 says SBAs fire "whenever any player would receive priority" — all four sites must be covered |
| 2026-02-21 | Layer 1 (Copy) and Layer 2 (Control) stubbed in M5 | Copy effects require CR 707 copiable-values logic that needs the full card definition framework (M7); control changes live on `GameObject.controller`, not `Characteristics`, so the layer calculation doesn't apply them |
| 2026-02-21 | `SetTypeLine` depends on `AddSubtypes`/`AddCardTypes` in dependency detection | This is the Blood Moon + Urborg fix: the set always follows the add regardless of timestamp. CR 613.8 says A depends on B if B changes what A applies to or does. |
| (project start) | SQLite for card data | Structured queries for card lookup; embedded DB ships with the app; no external server needed |
| (project start) | Separate engine/network/UI crates | Engine testable without IO; prevents coupling; allows future WASM compilation of engine alone |

## MCP Server Resources

When working on this project, the following MCP resources are available:

### Comprehensive Rules Search
- **Purpose**: Look up MTG rules by section number or concept
- **Use when**: Implementing any game rule, writing tests, resolving ambiguity
- **Query tips**: Search by rule number ("613.8") or concept ("dependency continuous effects")

### Card Data Lookup
- **Purpose**: Query oracle text, types, rulings for specific cards
- **Use when**: Implementing card definitions, writing interaction tests, verifying behavior
- **Query tips**: Search by exact card name for best results

### Rulings Search
- **Purpose**: Semantic search across all card rulings
- **Use when**: Implementing complex interactions, finding edge cases
- **Query tips**: Describe the interaction conceptually ("copy effect on double-faced card")

## Common Pitfalls & Gotchas

Things to watch out for, accumulated over development:

### MTG Rules Gotchas
- **Object identity (CR 400.7)**: When an object changes zones, it becomes a NEW object.
  The old ObjectId is dead. Auras fall off. "When this dies" triggers reference the old
  object. This is the #1 source of bugs in MTG engines.
- **Replacement effects are NOT triggers.** They modify events as they happen. They don't
  use the stack. Getting this wrong breaks the entire event system.
- **SBAs are checked as a batch, not individually.** All applicable SBAs happen simultaneously.
  Then triggers from all of them go on the stack together (in APNAP order).
- **The layer system dependency check must handle circular dependencies.** CR 613.8k says
  to fall back to timestamp order. If your dependency resolver can infinite-loop, it will.
- **"Commander damage" only counts COMBAT damage.** Not regular damage. And damage from
  a copy of a commander does NOT count — the copy isn't a commander.
- **Tokens cease to exist when they leave the battlefield** — but they DO briefly exist in
  the new zone first (long enough to trigger "when this dies" etc.).

### Rust Gotchas
- **`im-rs` HashMap iteration order is not deterministic** across different program runs
  (unless you use a fixed hasher). For deterministic replay, either sort before iterating
  or use `im::OrdMap`.
- **Recursive enums need `Box`** for the recursive variant. The `Effect` enum will need this
  for `Sequence(Vec<Effect>)` and `Conditional`.
- **Serialization of `im-rs` types**: `im` supports serde behind a feature flag. Enable it
  in Cargo.toml: `im = { version = "15", features = ["serde"] }`.

### Testing Gotchas
- **`ObjectSpec::card` + `.with_types([Creature])` creates a creature with `toughness: None`.**
  SBAs (704.5f/g/h) skip creatures with `None` toughness to avoid false positives.
  Use `ObjectSpec::creature(owner, name, power, toughness)` for any creature that SBAs should affect.
- **Don't test implementation details.** Test observable behavior. "After casting Lightning
  Bolt targeting player B, player B's life is 37" — not "the stack has one item of type
  InstantSpell with damage field 3."
- **Randomness in tests**: Libraries are shuffled. Use a seeded RNG (`StdRng::seed_from_u64`)
  in tests for deterministic library order.
- **Golden tests are fragile**: If you change the Event format, all golden test files break.
  Version the golden test schema.
- **1-player `start_game` doesn't reach Cleanup.** `active_players().len() == 1` makes
  `is_game_over()` return `true` (one winner), so `enter_step` emits a `GameOver` event
  and returns immediately — it never advances through cleanup. Tests that need cleanup to
  fire (e.g., verifying `UntilEndOfTurn` expiry via the full turn cycle) must use 2+ players.
  Layer system tests that only call `calculate_characteristics` can safely use 1 player.
- **Combat step turn-based actions fire when ENTERING the step, not exiting it.** When all
  players pass priority and `advance_step` transitions to e.g. `FirstStrikeDamage`, the
  `enter_step` call immediately runs `first_strike_damage_step()` and emits `CombatDamageDealt`
  + any SBA events (e.g. `CreatureDied`). These events appear in the `pass_all` that transitions
  INTO the step. The `pass_all` that exits the step (players passing priority within the step
  to move to the next step) produces events from entering the NEXT step, not the current one.
  Tests that look for first-strike damage must capture events from the first `pass_all`, not the second.
- **CR 510.1c damage assignment: last blocker gets ALL remaining power (no trample).** The
  "minimum lethal before moving to next blocker" rule only applies when there are subsequent
  blockers in the damage order. The final (or only) blocker without trample absorbs all remaining
  attacker power — it is not capped at lethal. Trample + last blocker: assign lethal, rest to player.

## Development Environment

### Environment Split

Engine development (M0-M9), networking (M10), and the card pipeline (M12) are pure Rust
with zero GUI dependencies. All of this work happens on the **Debian VM** over SSH.

Tauri UI work (M11+) requires a display server and platform webview libraries. This work
happens on the **Windows PC** with the same repo. Push from one machine, pull on the other.

This split doesn't need to be solved until M11 — roughly 6+ months into the project.

### Global Installs (Debian VM — one-time setup)

```bash
# Rust toolchain manager (per-user install, manages versions globally)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# sqlite3 CLI — for ad-hoc queries during development only
# The engine uses rusqlite with the "bundled" feature, so libsqlite3-dev is NOT needed
apt install sqlite3

# git (likely already installed)
apt install git

# nvm (Node Version Manager) — manages Node.js versions per-project
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or restart shell
```

### Project-Scoped Version Pinning

The repo pins its own tool versions so any machine or CI runner reproduces the same build:

```toml
# rust-toolchain.toml (repo root) — pins Rust version
[toolchain]
channel = "stable"
```

```
# .nvmrc (repo root) — pins Node.js version
22
```

```toml
# crates/card-db/Cargo.toml — bundles SQLite, no system dependency needed
[dependencies]
rusqlite = { version = "0.32", features = ["bundled"] }
```

After cloning the repo, the full setup is:
```bash
nvm use          # activates pinned Node version from .nvmrc
cargo build      # rustup reads rust-toolchain.toml automatically
cargo test --all # verify everything works
```

### Why These Choices

| Tool | Install Scope | Rationale |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| `rustup` | Global (per-user) | Designed to be global; reads `rust-toolchain.toml` per-project automatically |
| `sqlite3` CLI | Global (apt) | Lightweight dev convenience tool for ad-hoc queries; not a build dependency |
| `libsqlite3-dev` | **Not installed** | rusqlite's `bundled` feature compiles SQLite from source — no system lib needed, more portable |
| Node.js | Project-scoped (nvm) | Prevents version conflicts across projects; `.nvmrc` pins version in repo |
| `git` | Global (apt) | Already present on most systems; no version sensitivity |

### Windows PC Setup (M11+ only — not needed until Tauri UI work)

```powershell
# Rust
winget install Rustlang.Rustup

# Node.js (use nvm-windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
# Then: nvm install 22 && nvm use 22

# Tauri prerequisites (when the time comes)
# WebView2 — pre-installed on Windows 10/11
# Tauri CLI: cargo install tauri-cli
```

Same git repo, same `rust-toolchain.toml`, same `.nvmrc`. Everything builds identically.

### CI: GitHub Actions

- Runs on: Ubuntu (Linux), Windows, macOS
- Runs: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all`
- Nightly: performance benchmarks with regression alerts
- Tauri builds: cross-platform binaries via `tauri-action` (configured in M11)
